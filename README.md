# CSC104-3.1

# Guidelines and Expectations
Experiment with the different properties that affect text display, and various text formats to create effective and interesting page design. 
You can use for reference the constitution.html and style.css posted, which is just a plain black and white text version using some very basic CSS.

Be creative and come up with the formatting (text, background, spacing) to make this jump out and catch a viewer's attention.


# Deliverables:
Upload the html and css files to your public repo on GitHub. 
View the page using the GitHub HTML previewer: https://htmlpreview.github.io/Links to an external site.
Include Screen prints of your webpage from the GitHub HTML previewer, along with the HTML and CSS validations.
HTML validator https://validator.w3.org/Links to an external site.
CSS validator https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/Links to an external site.
